# Ryze AI – Website Redesign  
*(Frontend Internship Assignment)*

This project is a frontend redesign concept for the Ryze AI website, created as part of a Frontend Development Internship assignment.

The purpose of this project is to improve the website’s structure, user flow, and clarity of communication while keeping the design simple, clean, and professional.  
The focus is on frontend development best practices such as component-based architecture, routing, and user experience.

This is a **frontend-only project** and does not include backend or database functionality.

## 🔹 Project Overview

The redesigned website follows a SaaS-style layout with clear call-to-action buttons such as **Book a Demo** and **Request Pricing**.

The project demonstrates how a modern product website can be structured using reusable React components and organized styling, without relying on heavy external UI frameworks.

## 🔹 Pages Implemented

- **Home** – Introduces Ryze AI and its value proposition  
- **Features** – Highlights the core features of the product  
- **Pricing / Book Demo** – Displays pricing information and a simple form for demo or pricing requests  

---

## 🔹 How the Website Works

- The application is built using **React.js** with **JavaScript**.
- Page navigation is handled using **React Router DOM**.
- Each UI section (Navbar, Hero, Features, Testimonials, Footer) is implemented as a reusable component.
- The Pricing / Book Demo page contains input fields such as *Name, Email, and Company Size* to simulate a real SaaS user flow.
- All forms and inputs are created for **UI and UX demonstration purposes only** and do not submit or store data.
